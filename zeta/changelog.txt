++ Major Change

- Balance
~ Tweak
* Note

beta -> release

Note: Zeta is not based on AOW 2.1, however, for ease of understanding, this changelog is relative to the last version of 2.1 largely played.



=== GAMEPLAY ===

- Armor resistance now increases 1% per grade instead of 2%. This means grade 5 armor now offers 50% damage resistance instead of 60%.


=== CLASSES ===

- Chrono Archer: speed reduced to 85%, from 90%

- Technician: price increased to $300, from $200

- Demolitions Expert: speed reduced to 70%, from 75%

+ MachineGunner, MiniGunner and Jet Trooper have Bullet Resistance again.
(Bullet Resistance is 25% less effective than Energy & Explosion resistances)


=== WEAPONS ===

+ All weapon skins now have crouch sprites (except for medic)

+ Chainsaw is back to its Doom self, and no longer insta-kills everything, but still shreds people down very quickly (firing rate reduced)

- SMG: main and altfire have been swapped. Both are also slightly less accurate.

- Gatling Gun shoots twice as many bullets (but damage per bullet is halved), vertical spread lowered.
Essentially, it is a bit less effective beyond short range.

- Chrono Bow charges nearly twice as fast, bolt speed and damage scales SLIGHTLY less with charging, and maximum damage is slightly lower.
Blast radius was also reduced considerably. However, Chrono Bow damage completely ignores armor, and can consistently 2-shot even maximum rank infantry.

- Grenade Launcher's grenades have slightly less gravity, thus increased range.

~ Missile Launcher's homing no longer stops working randomly. Blast away!

~ Tiberium and Combustion autorifles have more devastating altfires on their strong version.
	
=== MECHS ===
+ New heavy mech, Rhino.
	* Comes with a Shock Cannon, Plasma Cannon, and LRM-10.
+ Wolverine gets a new coat of paint
+ Titan and wolverine now have firing animations.
- Orca cost increased from 1000 -> 1250
	
=== BUILDINGS === 
- Base Crasher and Base Miracle changes.
	* Will no longer activate during sudden death, and five minutes before it
	* Crasher no longer activate if any buildings are below 50% hp.
- Adv Tiberium harvesting money reduced.
	
=== MAPS ===
++ All maps starting rooms have been standardized.

=== MISC ===
++ All cvars changed from aow_ to zeta_
	* This is because we are now using CVARINFO, which doesn't allow us to reuse existing CVARS.
	
=== FIXES ===
- Sandbags should no longer be glitchy when placed near ledges.
- All Mechs are big again
- Missile Launcher actually homes onto targets again.
- Ravens no longer spawn when you eject out of a mech.
- You can no longer destroy your own obelisk with an orca.
- Timed C4 flames no longer hurt your own base or teammates.
- Base Miracle no longer occurs if your buildings are at full health.
- You can no longer use C4's while piloting a mech.
- Many, many ACS fixes.
